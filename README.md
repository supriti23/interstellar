## Proudest Achievement
 When I had joined HCL Technologies, I did not have much experience in working with React framework. I had worked mostly in vanilla JavaScript before that. After joining, I had to take up the task to develop a multistep form in React. I'm proud of this delivery as I was learning and implementing new things parallelly. This was a challenge for me because I had to learn a lot of things in a short period of time as well as deliver the solution.
 
## Recent Article
 Recently, I have read an article about the lazy loading feature in React.

 Lazy loading is a way in which you do not need to load all the components at once. It is a technique to render important elements first and render noncritical items later. This makes the app more efficient and also improves the user experience. This is a new and interesting feature of React and I think this will be helpful in performance optimization. So, I recommend going through this once.
